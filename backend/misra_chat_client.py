            Thank you for confirming. The C++ file content you received previously is the current state of the file, which may have already undergone some fixes.

            Now, I am providing you with a list of **specific, currently unresolved MISRA C++ violations** that need to be addressed in the file. **For each violation in this list, I require a fixed code snippet.**

            Your task is to:
            1.  **Identify the specific code location** for each violation in the `CURRENT MISRA Violations to Fix` list within the C++ file you previously received.
            2.  **Apply the necessary MISRA C++ compliant fix** to that code.
            3.  **Provide ONLY the fixed C++ code snippet** for each violation. This snippet should be a small, relevant section of the code including the fix and enough surrounding context to clearly identify its position.

            **Important Note on Previous Fixes:**
            If a violation listed below is related to an issue you have previously fixed (e.g., a change to a macro definition that impacts multiple usage sites), and your analysis indicates that the *same type of fix* is still applicable for this new reported instance, please **re-provide the appropriate fixed code snippet** for this specific line. Do not state that it is "already addressed"; instead, act as if it's a new instance requiring the same solution.

            Ensure all fixes:
            * Strictly adhere to MISRA C++ guidelines.
            * Preserve the original functionality.
            * Maintain the existing coding style and formatting (indentation, braces, comments, empty lines betweens functions etc.).
            * **Do NOT introduce any new MISRA violations.**
            * **Crucially, maintain the original line numbering prefix for each line in the fixed snippet.** Only modify the C++ code *after* the colon.
            * *** If you insert **any new lines**, you must assign them a **line number based on the preceding line**, followed by lowercase letters in alphabetical order.
            - Example: If a new line is to be inserted **after line 100**, label it as `100a:`. If more than one line is added after line 100, continue as `100b:`, `100c:`, and so on.**
            * **If a line's content should be removed or made empty as part of a fix, output only its line number followed by a colon (e.g., `123:`). Do NOT omit the line number itself.**

            ---

            **Output Instructions (Continuation):**
            Don't add `...` for non-fixed parts.
            Don't remove the lines between functions if any.
            Give all changed/fixed lines in a single snippet for all violations.
            If there are too many fixed snippets to fit into a single response due to output token limits, provide a partial set. After each response, if more snippets are remaining, explicitly state: `--- CONTINUED ---` and wait for my 'next' command to provide the next batch. Do not provide any more output until I type 'next'.
            If you have provided all requested fixed snippets for this batch of violations, simply stop. Do NOT output `--- CONTINUED ---`.

            ---

            Here is the list of violations to fix:
